This program allows the user to run as many simultaneous Financial Literacy simulations as they would like. It will output a results file for each person simulation that is run. The program can be extended to run as many simulations as the user would like. It cannot output all results into the same file.
*I have left the algorithm testing main() (that does not support file IO) for testing convenience. 
*This program has constants, defined in [the main...] main(), that could be changed to perform a different simulation

To run the program, give the desired input file(s) as command line arguments. You MUST use this input file format.


INPUT FILE FORMAT - value on separate lines, same order, no extra punctuation or chars. Use a double unless otherwise specified
